<strong>Please note:</strong> We usually take bookings months in
advance but sometimes can work with just a few weeks notice. The band is
especially busy in the summer and at Christmas time and as an amateur
organisation, would not usually be available during the working week.</p>

<h2>Payment</h2>

<p>We play for the love of making music and do not receive payment as
individuals. Our engagement fees pay for our sheet music,
rehearsal facilities, instruments and uniform. We aim to cater for most
budgets and strive to provide excellent value for money. An appropriate
fee will be quoted once we know what you want. To give you an idea,
a 2 x 45 minute performances with 20 players and a 15 minute refreshment
break would cost around Â£300 at a local venue.</p>
